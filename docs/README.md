### Overview

The VictorySunburst ecology component (`docs.jsx`) is imported by [victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory) to render the documentation site at http://victory.formidable.com.

### Development

Run `npm run dev-docs` to start `webpack-dev-server` at port 3000. Run `npm run check` for the usual linting, which covers the `docs` source.

#### Happy, victorious developing! :trophy:
